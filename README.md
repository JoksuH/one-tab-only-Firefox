One Tab Only  - Firefox Extension
============

One tab only Firefox extension disallows opening more than one tab when active.

The desire to create this productive addon came to me after I got frustrated with my attention running away to other tabs when searching for programming related answers in the Internet.

## Features
- Turn on or off from the icon
